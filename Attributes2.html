	  <h1>How It Started</h1><br />I set out early today for Sunday service because it was a <em>combined</em><dfn><i>a service that holds usually on Sundays wherin, all the branches within a particular state come together for one service at the</i><b>state <abbr title="headquarters">HQ</abbr>HQ</b>.<dfn>
	</p>

	   <h2>How It Ended</h2>
	
	I had a <del>round trip</del> to Dutse and Jabi today, it was <s>frigging</s> expensive but thankfully I had help. Had a great time and conversation just like in the book <cite>Dake Carnegie's How to win friends and influence people</cite><q>men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes todeath, but always to victory</q></p>
